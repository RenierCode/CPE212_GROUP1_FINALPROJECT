        <h1>FINAL PROJECT - GROUP 1</h1>
        <p>This intricate final project is a comprehensive culmination of everything we have worked on individually throughout the semester, brought together into a single unified HTML website.
        The project centers on the utilization of Docker, beginning with the creation of a Dockerfile, progressing it to the generation of Docker images, and finally deploying them as Docker containers.
        This step-by-step process shows our understanding and application of Docker's functionalities. By integrating all the skills and knowledge we have obtained, this final output serves as both a summary of our learning journey and experience, as well as a platform to enhance and display our innovative capabilities in a practical, creative, and impactful output.</p>
